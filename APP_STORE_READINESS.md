   - Backup: Have staging environment ready

2. **Payment Integration** - Not implemented
   - Mitigation: Mark as future feature
   - Note: MVP version, payments coming soon

3. **Security** - User financial data
   - Mitigation: Use encryption, secure storage
   - Note: Already implemented with best practices

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Authentication** - MFA complexity
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing on devices
   - Fallback: Basic auth still available

2. **Performance** - Large transaction lists
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, caching
   - Status: Need to verify on older devices

### Low Risk Areas
1. **UI/UX** - Material Design compliance
2. **Analytics** - Sentry integration
3. **Notifications** - Push notification system
