## Technical Architecture

2. **Better understanding** - Visual charts easier to parse than text
3. **Guided discovery** - Suggestions help users explore features
4. **Clear feedback** - Status indicators show what's happening
5. **Seamless navigation** - Action buttons link to relevant sections

### For Development
1. **Modular design** - Each component is self-contained
2. **Type-safe** - Metadata structure enforced via entities
3. **Extensible** - Easy to add new message types
4. **Backward compatible** - Legacy handlers still work
5. **Testable** - Pure functions and clear separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2 & 3)

### Phase 2 - Medium Impact
- [ ] Voice input support
- [ ] Search chat history
- [ ] Message editing and resend
- [ ] Streaming responses (character-by-character)
- [ ] Export conversations to PDF

### Phase 3 - Polish & Intelligence
- [ ] Export and share insights
- [ ] Message reactions (helpful, not helpful)
- [ ] Smart notifications for chat-worthy events
- [ ] Proactive insights ("I noticed you spent more...")
- [ ] User preference learning
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation context
- [ ] Receipt image attachment support

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Flutter analyze passes (warnings only for deprecated APIs)
- [ ] Category query shows pie chart
- [ ] Balance query shows action buttons
- [ ] Follow-up suggestions are tappable
- [ ] Typing indicator appears during processing
- [ ] Message status indicators work
- [ ] Error messages styled correctly
- [ ] Chat history persists across sessions
- [ ] Scroll-to-bottom works smoothly
- [ ] Action buttons trigger correct behavior

## Performance Considerations

1. **Chart Rendering** - Limited to top 5 categories to prevent performance issues
2. **Message History** - Limited to 50 messages in storage
3. **Lazy Loading** - ListView.builder for efficient rendering
4. **Animation Optimization** - SingleTickerProviderStateMixin for typing indicator
5. **Metadata Size** - Chart data pre-processed to minimize storage

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Deprecated APIs** - Using `withOpacity()` instead of `withValues()` (Flutter 3.37+)
   - Impact: Minor precision loss in color calculations
   - Fix: Update to `withValues()` in future Flutter version migration

2. **Legacy Handlers** - Old query handlers kept for backward compatibility
   - Impact: Unused code warnings in analyzer
   - Fix: Can be removed in future major version

3. **Action Button Navigation** - Currently shows placeholders
   - Impact: Some buttons don't navigate to real destinations
   - Fix: Implement proper routing in production

## Migration Guide

### Existing Code Compatibility
All existing code continues to work. The `processQuery()` method now internally calls `processQueryRich()` and extracts just the text content.

### To Adopt Rich Features
Replace `ChatMessageBubble` with `EnhancedChatMessageBubble`:

```dart
// Old
ChatMessageBubble(message: message)

// New
EnhancedChatMessageBubble(
  message: message,
  onFollowUpTap: _handleSendMessage,
  onActionTap: _handleActionTap,
)
```
