## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
**Table:** `settlements`

```sql
CREATE TABLE settlements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id UUID REFERENCES bill_groups(id),
  from_user UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  to_user UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  amount DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  evidence_url TEXT,
  settled_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Data Flow
```
User clicks "Settle Up"
  ‚Üí SettleUpBottomSheet opens
  ‚Üí Shows current balance summary
  ‚Üí User selects direction (paid/received)
  ‚Üí User selects recipient/payer
  ‚Üí User enters amount and notes
  ‚Üí Submit
  ‚Üí settlementOperationsProvider.createSettlement()
  ‚Üí BillSplittingRepository.createSettlement()
  ‚Üí BillSplittingRemoteDatasource.createSettlement()
  ‚Üí Supabase INSERT into settlements table
  ‚Üí Returns Settlement entity
  ‚Üí Invalidates providers (balances, settlements)
  ‚Üí UI refreshes automatically
  ‚Üí Success snackbar shown
```

### State Management
**Providers Used:**
- `groupSettlementsProvider(groupId)` - FutureProvider for fetching settlements
- `settlementOperationsProvider` - StateNotifierProvider for create operations
- `groupBalancesProvider(groupId)` - FutureProvider for calculating balances

**Auto-refresh Logic:**
After recording settlement:
```dart
ref.invalidate(groupBalancesProvider(groupId));
ref.invalidate(groupSettlementsProvider(groupId));
```

## Visual Design

### Color Coding
- üü¢ **Green** - Money you received or are owed
  - `AppColors.success`
  - Used for: Positive balance, received payments, downward arrows

- üî¥ **Red** - Money you paid or owe
  - `AppColors.error`
  - Used for: Negative balance, paid settlements, upward arrows

- ‚ö™ **Gray** - Neutral or other users' transactions
  - `AppColors.textSecondary`
  - Used for: Horizontal arrows (others' settlements)

### Icons
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Arrow Up** - Payment made
- ‚¨áÔ∏è **Arrow Down** - Payment received
- ‚ÜîÔ∏è **Arrow Horizontal** - Others' payment
- ‚úì **Check Circle** - Settled up (zero balance)
- üí∞ **Attach Money** - Amount field
- üë§ **Person** - User selection
- üìù **Note** - Notes field

### Layout Principles
- **Cards** - Settlement items use Material cards
- **Gradients** - Balance section uses teal-blue gradient
- **Rounded Corners** - Consistent `AppSizes.radiusMd`
- **Spacing** - Proper padding with `AppSizes` constants
- **Typography** - Material 3 text styles with appropriate weights

---

## Error Handling

### Form Validation
- ‚úÖ Amount must be greater than 0
- ‚úÖ User must be selected
- ‚úÖ Decimal input only (prevents invalid characters)
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation with error messages

### API Error Handling
- ‚úÖ Try-catch blocks around all async operations
- ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages in snackbars
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation (empty state if fetch fails)
- ‚úÖ Retry capability via pull-to-refresh

### Edge Cases Handled
- ‚úÖ Zero balance - Shows "settled up" message
- ‚úÖ No available users - Shows informative message
- ‚úÖ Network errors - Shows error snackbar
- ‚úÖ Duplicate submissions - Prevented by loading state
- ‚úÖ Missing user names - Falls back to "Unknown"

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Recommended)
- [ ] Open a group with balances
- [ ] Tap "Settle Up" button
- [ ] Verify balance summary shows correct amount and color
- [ ] Toggle between "I paid" and "I received"
- [ ] Verify dropdown filters users correctly

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading** - Settlement history shows last 3 by default
2. **Efficient Queries** - Settlements fetched with user names via JOIN
3. **Provider Caching** - Riverpod caches settlement data
4. **Selective Refresh** - Only invalidates affected providers
5. **Optimistic Updates** - Could be added for instant feedback (future enhancement)
