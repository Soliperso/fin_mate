## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Run Specific Category
```bash
flutter test test/unit/           # Unit tests only
flutter test test/widget/         # Widget tests only
flutter test test/integration/    # Integration tests only
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

### Watch Mode
```bash
flutter test --watch
```

## Test Quality

### Code Coverage
Current test coverage includes:
- ✅ Core entities and models
- ✅ Utility functions and formatters
- ✅ UI component behavior
- ✅ User workflows and auth flows
- ✅ Transaction operations

### Test Best Practices Applied
- ✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Isolated test cases
- ✅ Clear assertions
- ✅ Mock data helpers
- ✅ Test setup utilities

## Next Steps

### Expand Test Coverage
1. **Repository Tests**: Mock Supabase calls and test data operations
2. **Provider Tests**: Test Riverpod state management
3. **Page Tests**: More comprehensive page-level testing
4. **Error Handling**: Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Integration Testing
1. **UI Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows end-to-end
2. **Backend Integration**: Test with real Supabase (staging)
3. **Device Testing**: Test on real iOS devices

### Continuous Integration
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
2. Run tests automatically on PRs
3. Enforce code coverage minimums (70%+)
4. Block merges if tests fail

## Testing Tools

### Installed Dependencies
- **flutter_test** - Flutter testing framework
- **mocktail** - Mocking library for tests

### Best Practices Included
- Test setup helpers in `test/test_setup.dart`
- Mock data generators in `TestData` class
- Common test widget builders
- Widget tester extensions

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/unit/entities/transaction_entity_test.dart

# Watch mode (re-run on changes)
flutter test --watch

```

## Integration with App Store

Tests help ensure:
- ✅ Code quality and best practices
- ✅ Business logic correctness
- ✅ UI functionality
- ✅ User workflow integrity
- ✅ Regression prevention

## Notes

- All tests are isolated and can run independently
- Tests use mocks to avoid external dependencies
- Test data is self-contained and doesn't require setup
- Tests are fast and suitable for CI/CD pipelines
- Widget tests don't require devices or emulators
