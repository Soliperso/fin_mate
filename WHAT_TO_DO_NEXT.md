# What You Need to Do Next 🎯

## Current Situation

Your app is running, but you **can't see the admin badge** because:

1. ❌ The database migration hasn't been run yet
2. ❌ The `role` column doesn't exist in `user_profiles` table yet
3. ❌ Your user hasn't been set as admin yet

## Solution (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

1. Open: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sfgazuuopgrnkhvciawm/sql/new**
2. Copy entire contents of: `supabase/migrations/10_add_admin_role.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**

Expected result: ✅ "Success. No rows returned"

---

### Step 2: Set Yourself as Admin

In the same SQL editor, run this (replace with your actual email):

```sql
UPDATE public.user_profiles
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';
```

Expected result: ✅ "Success. 1 row affected"

---

### Step 3: Refresh Your Profile in the App

**NEW FEATURE:** The app now has pull-to-refresh!

1. Navigate to **Profile** page in the app
2. **Pull down** on the screen to refresh
3. You should see loading indicator
4. When it finishes, you'll see:
   - ✨ **Admin badge** (shield icon + "Admin" text) under your email
   - ✨ **Admin section** in settings with 3 menu items

**Alternative:** If pull-to-refresh doesn't work, just:
- Kill the app completely
- Restart it
- Navigate to Profile page

## How to Check the Logs (Debug Info)

While the app is running, check the console for these debug messages:

```
🔍 Profile data from database: {...}
🔍 Role field value: admin
🔍 ProfileModel created with role: admin, isAdmin: true
```

If you see `role: user` or `role: null`, it means:
- Migration wasn't run, OR
- You didn't set yourself as admin yet

---

## What the Admin Features Look Like

### 1. Admin Badge (in profile header)
- Small badge with white border
- Shield icon + "Admin" text
- Semi-transparent white background
- Located between your email and "Edit Profile" button

### 2. Admin Section (in settings)
- New section titled "Admin"
- Located after "Support" section, before "Log Out" button
- Contains 3 items:
  - 👥 User Management
  - 📊 System Analytics
  - ⚙️ System Settings
- Tapping any item shows "Coming soon!" message

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I ran the migration but still don't see the badge"

1. Check console logs for errors
2. Pull down to refresh on Profile page
3. Verify your email is correct in the SQL query
4. Run this to verify role was set:

```sql
SELECT email, role FROM public.user_profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### "I see an error in the SQL editor"

If you see "column already exists", that's OK! The migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS`, so it won't break anything.

If you see other errors, let me know the exact error message.
