# AI Insights - Wells Fargo Fargo-Inspired Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive AI Insights feature inspired by Wells Fargo's "Fargo" virtual assistant. The implementation includes conversational AI, 30-day balance forecasting, and proactive financial guidance.

## Features Implemented

### 1. 30-Day Balance Forecasting (Wells Fargo Cash Flow Monitor)

**Predictive Balance Projection:**
- Projects daily balance for the next 30 days
- Formula: `Current Balance + Scheduled Income - Scheduled Expenses - Average Daily Spending`
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Healthy**: Balance â‰¥ $500
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Warning**: Balance between $100-$500
  - ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Balance < $100

**Key Components:**
- Visual timeline chart with balance trends
- Daily breakdown showing scheduled transactions
- Low-balance warnings (e.g., "Your balance may go negative on March 15")
- "Safe to spend" calculator
- Takes into account:
  - Current account balances
  - Recurring transactions (bills, subscriptions, income)
  - Future one-time transactions
  - Historical spending patterns (90-day average)

### 2. Conversational AI Chat Interface

**Natural Language Query Processing:**
The system can understand and respond to various financial queries:

**Balance Queries:**
- "What's my current balance?"
- "How much money do I have?"
- "Show my account balances"

**Bill Queries:**
- "What bills are due soon?"
- "When is my next bill?"
- "Show upcoming payments"

**Spending Queries:**

- "Show my dining spending"
- "What did I spend last week?"

**Affordability Queries:**
- "Can I afford a $500 purchase?"
- "Can I buy something for $200?"

**Forecast Queries:**
- "What's my balance next week?"
- "Show my balance forecast"
- "What will my balance be tomorrow?"

**Income Queries:**
- "How much did I earn this month?"
- "Show my income"

**Category Queries:**
- "Show spending by category"
- "Break down my expenses"

**Chat Features:**
- Message bubbles (user vs AI)
- User avatar (person icon) and AI avatar (sparkle icon)
- Timestamp on each message

## Data Sources

### Supabase Tables Used

**Primary Tables:**
- `transactions` - All financial transactions
- `accounts` - Account balances
- `categories` - Transaction categories
- `user_profiles` - User information

**Queries:**
- Recurring transactions filtering (`is_recurring = true`)
- Date range filtering for analysis
- User-specific data (`user_id` filter)
- Category joins for spending breakdown

---

## Algorithm Details

### Balance Forecasting Algorithm

```
For each day D in next 30 days:
  1. Start with: running_balance
  2. Calculate scheduled_income for day D
     - Check recurring transactions (next occurrence on D)
     - Check future one-time transactions (date = D)
  3. Calculate scheduled_expenses for day D
     - Check recurring bills (next occurrence on D)
     - Check future one-time expenses (date = D)
  4. Add average_daily_spending (from historical data)
  5. Update: running_balance = running_balance + scheduled_income - scheduled_expenses - avg_daily_spending
  6. Determine status based on running_balance
  7. Record forecast for day D
```

**Recurring Transaction Projection:**
```
Calculate next occurrence based on interval:
- daily: +1 day
- weekly: +7 days
- biweekly: +14 days
- monthly: +1 month (same day)
- quarterly: +3 months
- yearly: +1 year
```

**Safe to Spend Calculation:**
```
min_balance = min(projected_balance over next 30 days)
buffer = $100
safe_to_spend = current_balance - (current_balance - min_balance) - buffer
```

---

### Query Processing Algorithm

**Intent Detection:**
Uses keyword matching to determine query type:

```
Query Type              Keywords
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Balance                balance, how much, account
Bills                  bill, due, payment, pay
Spending               spend, spent, spending
Affordability          afford, can i buy, purchase
Forecast               forecast, predict, next week/month
Income                 income, earn, salary
Category               category, categories
Savings                save, saving, savings
Help                   help, what can, how do
```

**Response Generation:**
1. Parse query for intent and parameters
2. Extract time period (today, week, month, last month)
3. Extract category if mentioned
4. Extract amount if present (e.g., "$500")
5. Query Supabase for relevant data
6. Format response with currency formatting
7. Return natural language response
