# Settings Feature - Integration Guide

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase dashboard:
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Create a new query
# 3. Copy contents of: supabase/migrations/17_add_user_settings_columns.sql
# 4. Execute the query
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Test the Feature
```bash
flutter run
```

Then navigate to `/settings` from anywhere in the app.

## üéØ How to Access Settings

### Option A: Add Settings Button to Profile Page (Optional)
If you want to add a settings button to the profile page, you can simply add this button:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.settings),
  onPressed: () => context.push('/settings'),
),
```

The profile page already has a TODO comment at line 26 showing where to add this.

### Option B: Add Settings to Navigation
The settings feature is accessible via the route `/settings` and can be navigated to from anywhere in your app.

## üì± Route Navigation

```dart
// Navigate to main settings
context.push('/settings');

// Navigate to notification settings
context.push('/settings/notifications');

// Navigate to display settings
context.push('/settings/display');

// Navigate to data & privacy
context.push('/settings/data-privacy');
```

## üîß Configuration

### Theme Persistence
Theme preference is stored in two places:
1. **Local**: SharedPreferences (for offline-first access)
2. **Remote**: Supabase user_profiles (for cloud sync)

The theme automatically persists when user changes it.

### Notification Preferences
All notification settings are stored as a JSONB object in `user_profiles.notification_preferences`.

### Data Export
Exported data is shared using the system share dialog and can be:
- Emailed
- Saved to files
- Printed
- Uploaded to cloud storage

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Theme Switching
1. Go to `/settings/display`
2. Select different theme options
3. Close and reopen app
4. Verify theme persists

### Test 2: Notification Preferences
1. Go to `/settings/notifications`
2. Toggle switches and adjust sliders
3. Refresh the page to verify changes saved

### Test 3: Data Export
1. Go to `/settings/data-privacy`
2. Click "Export All Data"
3. Save or email the JSON file
4. Verify JSON contains correct data structure

### Test 4: Account Deletion
1. Go to `/settings/data-privacy`
2. Click "Delete Account"
3. Follow multi-step confirmation
4. Verify user is logged out and redirected to login

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Settings page shows loading indefinitely
**Solution**: Check that user is authenticated and database migration is applied

### Issue: Theme doesn't persist after restart
**Solution**: Ensure SharedPreferences is initialized. Theme is stored locally in SharedPreferences.

### Issue: Data export fails
**Solution**: Verify user has transactions/budgets data to export. Export formats require specific data structure.

### Issue: Account deletion fails
**Solution**: Check that password confirmation is correct. User must re-authenticate.

## üìã Feature Checklist

- [x] Settings page displays all sections
- [x] Theme preference persists across app restarts
- [x] Notification preferences save correctly
- [x] Display settings update database
- [x] Data export generates valid files
- [x] Account deletion works with confirmation
- [x] All pages have proper error handling
- [x] Material 3 design is consistent
- [x] Routes integrate with existing router
- [x] No conflicts with profile page

## üîê Security Notes

1. **RLS Policies**: All user settings are protected by row-level security
2. **Authentication**: Settings operations require authenticated user
3. **Password Confirmation**: Account deletion requires password re-entry
4. **Data Privacy**: User can export and delete all their data

## üìä Data Structures

### NotificationPreferences (JSONB)
```json
{
  "push_enabled": true,
  "email_enabled": false,
  "sound_enabled": true,
  "budget_alerts": true,
  "budget_threshold": 80,
  "bill_reminders": true,
  "bill_reminder_days": 1,
  "transaction_alerts": false,
  "transaction_threshold": 1000,
  "money_health_updates": "weekly",
  "goal_notifications": "milestones"
}
```

### User Settings Columns
```sql
theme_mode TEXT -- 'light', 'dark', 'system'
language TEXT -- 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'de'
notification_preferences JSONB -- see above
```

## üé® Customization

### Change Theme Options
Edit `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/display_settings_page.dart`

### Add More Notification Options
1. Update `NotificationPreferences` in `settings_entity.dart`
2. Add new fields to `notification_settings_page.dart`
3. Update Supabase migration if needed

### Customize Export Format
Edit `lib/core/services/data_export_service.dart` to change:
- JSON structure
- CSV headers
- File naming conventions
- Data filtering
